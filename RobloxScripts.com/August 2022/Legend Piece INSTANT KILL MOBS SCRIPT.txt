   You have to hit the mob to get kill credit
   I am to lazy to make an auto farm if you really want to do it urself

   litterally just punch the mob you want to get the kill credit for and press the singlekey
   it will kill the nearest mob

   Script by: CompileError
   Im not gonna bother doing anything else with this if you want to add it to a hub be my guest
   If the devs give any shits about this game it would be patch pretty quick anyways so yeah

   litterally just deletes the UpperTorso XD
   No it does not work on players
   I have not tried it on NPCs nor am I going to

   Do what you want with this
   you can also change the key bind as idk what keys are and are not used in game
   Defult G
